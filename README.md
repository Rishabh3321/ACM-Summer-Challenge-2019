# **[ACM SUMMER CHALLENGE - 2019](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/college/acm-summer-challenge-2019-1/)** 

### Introduction :-
The contest was all about competitive coding and introduces basic level of all concepts used in competitive coding .This is a 45 days long challenge with 15 different topics (13 topics -problems sets of 3 or 4 questions,2 topics -MCQ Quiz). It was a great journey from #Day1 to #Day45. I learned a lot about STL (containers,iterators,algorithms,etc.). Really,the power of C++ is way more than i was thinking before this challenge. 

### Path :-  

 - Tutiorals  (including Links from different websites like Hackerearth,Codeforces,Topcoder,etc.)
 - Practice-Problems  (including Links from different websites like Hackerearth,Codeforces,Topcoder,etc.)
 - Problems (These are set of 3 or 4 problems on Hackerearth for online assessment.)

In every three days a problem or quiz set is released at 12:00 pm
